Aps-planning-system:
Manufacturing planning backend simulating Infor APS behavior
This project is a demo backend application simulating the behavior of an Advanced Planning & Scheduling (APS) system used in manufacturing ERP platforms such as Infor APS.
It demonstrates how production orders are planned based on demand, supply availability and system capacity using a microservice-based backend architecture.
Technologies Used:Java,Spring Boot,REST APIs,Multithreading,Maven,Git.
Key Features:
Executes manufacturing planning cycles using backend services
Demonstrates asynchronous execution using Java multithreading
Simulates APS demand & supply planning behavior
Clean layered architecture for maintainability
Learning Outcomes:
Designing scalable backend microservices
Implementing async processing using Java
Structuring ERP-like planning modules
